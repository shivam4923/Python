# The diameter of the binary tree is defined as the total number of nodes on the longest path between two end nodes.
# Diameter = Left subtree height + Right subtree height + 1

# RECURSIVE APPROACH
# Time Complexity
'''
The time complexity of the above approach is O(n^2) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
It is because, the function recursively calls itself, and hence, every node is visited at least
twice while calculating the diameter.
However, the space complexity of the recursive approach is O(n) because of recursion.

'''
Time Complexity
The time complexity using this approach is O(n) and therefore, it is considered to be an optimized solution 
for calculating the diameter of a binary tree. 
It is because using the iterative approach, we only visit the nodes of the tree once. 
At the same time, the space complexity of this approach is also O(n) where n is the number of nodes present in the tree.
